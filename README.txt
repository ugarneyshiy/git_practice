### Hey! Dear friend!
### This is the first serious project that I developed entirely by myself.
### I hope you like it!

# Project Title: the name of my project

# Description: This is an extremely important component of the README. I should describe
the main purpose of my project. Answer questions like "why did i build this project?" and
"what problem(s) does it solve?". It also helps to include my motivations for the project
and what i learned from it.

# Features: If my project has multiple features, list them here. Don't be afraid to brag if
my project has unique features that make it stand out. I can even add screenshots and gifs
to show off the features.

# How to use: Here, i should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use mine 
project. Any software or package requirements should also listed here.

# Technologies: List all the technologies and/or frameworks i used and what purpose they
serve in my project.

# Collaborators: If others have contributed to my project in any way, it is important to
give tham credit for their work. White your team members' or collaborators' names here along
with a link to their GitHub profile

# License: It's also important to list a license on my README so other developers can
understand what they can and cannot do with my project. I can use this guide to help me
choose a license
